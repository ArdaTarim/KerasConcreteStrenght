# KerasConcreteStrenght

machine learning with Keras to find concrete strength

This is the final project of "Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras" from Coursera.
In the project, I tested the effects of the different hyperparameters as well as more hidden layers.

## First Project

    after evaluating with 50 iterations and training with 50 epochs
    average MSE is 105.02 and has std 144.72

## Second Project

    with normalized data, evaluating with 50 iterations and training with 50 epochs
    average MSE is 52.0 and has std 52.37

## Third Project

    with normalized data, evaluating with 50 iterations and training with 100 epochs
    average MSE is 41.73 and has std 17.3

## Fourth Project

    with normalized data, 3 hidden layers evaluating with 50 iterations and training with 50 epochs
    average MSE is 34.24 and has std 12.24
